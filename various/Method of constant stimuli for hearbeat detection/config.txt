# Write n=label to select hardware channel number n (starting from 1)
# and attach a label to it. This will show up in the Fieldtrip buffer
# and the GDF file.
# Currently, there is no check for double inclusion of channels.
# That is, if you define 1=FOO and 1=BAR, the first hardware channel
# will show up twice, with different names.
# Channels listed before the first [save] or [stream] line will be added
# to both saving and streaming selections. Write [select] to enable 
# selection for both saving and streaming.
[select]
1=RA
2=LL

# Now we add some more channel for saving only
[save]
3=LA

# And some channels we only want to stream
[stream]

66=C2

# Please take note that the channels will be written out in the order specified here,
# that is, they will not be sorted according to the hardware channel number!

# Write "downsample X" with a positive number X to set the downsampling
# factor for streaming. The GDF file will receive full-rate data.
downsample 8

# Write "bandwidth X" with a positive real number X to set the cutoff frequency
# of a Butterworth low-pass filter.
#bandwidth 50

# Write "bworder N" to set the order of the lowpass Butterworth filter for downsampling
#bworder 4

# Refresh period (in seconds) for inserting extra events. 
# Battery events are sent out in a fixed interval (set 0 to disable).
# Status events are sent out when the status changes, OR when the specified
# time has elapsed after the last event was sent out.

# Triggers will be written as FieldTrip buffer events with type="TRIGGER" and a
# value corresponding to the 16-bit trigger signal.
# With the keyword splittrigger, you can opt to split the 16-bit trigger signal
# into two 8-bit signals, and give names to the events that are sent out for the
# low and high byte of the original signal, respectively.
