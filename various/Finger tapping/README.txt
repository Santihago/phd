This experiment asks participants in every trial to do a hand movement.
Each trial starts by a go cue (beep sound). Participants are asked to fixate the cross in the center of the screen (to minimise eye movements) and to perform the movement when they feel like moving.

The next trial starts by pressing ’n’ (there is a 5s ITI).

EEG triggers are sent to ActiView to start (255) and stop (254) recording.
A trigger is also sent at the beginning of each trial (1).

There are 4 blocks with 40 trials each, with breaks in between.

To-do:
- verify eeg triggers
